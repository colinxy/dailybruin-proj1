### Challenges and Mistakes

We want to give the website a modern feel by setting the background to
a blurry picture. Although the design made the website a lot prettier,
this caused many potential problems of readability.

When we put the text content onto the website, we realized that the
text are not quite readable from the background. So we added a wrapper
on top of the background, adding more contrast to the text.

### Possible Improvements

The website is designed using pure HTML/CSS, but with the use of
javascript, a lot of dynamic content can be added, and thus make the
website a lot prettier.

Also the font size of the content are mostly hardcoded, so it might
not look well on a mobile device.
